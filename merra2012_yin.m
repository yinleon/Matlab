% Data taken from a 2012 reanalysis fron NASA's Merra system contains     %
% rich 4-dimensional(longitude,latitude,pressure,month) data fields.      %
% The data is scrubbed and used to calculate the zonally averaged         %
% (1a) temperature, (1b) wind velocity, (2) mass transport, and           %
% (3) reletive humidity for January and July 2012. The data is used       %
% to analyze convection cells, jetstreams, and atmospheric moisture.      %
